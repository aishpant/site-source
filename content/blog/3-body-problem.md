TL;DR, 3.5 out of 5 stars


I really really wanted to like The Three Body Problem a lot more because of the
numerous positive reviews I've been hearing. I thought it was very interesting
(Gobbled it up in three days straight!). It was full of great ideas and very
imaginative. The parts in which we enter the game simulation were so fun to
read. It was unfortunate when the game came abruptly to an end.

This may be spoilerish now. The characterization was _not_ great. Take police
officer Da Shi for example. He was such a cliche. And I did not understand
whether the author sympathized with Ye Wenjie or opposed her. Then there were
these other wooden characters devoid of any feeling- Shen Yufei, Wei Cheng,
Wenjie's mother, Yang Dong etc. I admit much of the physics stuff went over my
head. (Jeez, how many people could really imagine an 11-dimensional object
unfolding in 2-dimensions as a proton?). Also, I am not a fan of the overall
theme of misanthropy subscribed to by 70% characters in the book.

Regardless, I am looking forward to reading Dark Forest (second in the
Remembrance of the Earth's past trilogy). It's always a good idea to be reading
books that produce conflicted feelings in you.
