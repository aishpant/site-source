> A review of I, Robot and The Caves of Steel, and the problematic characterisation of women.

I have a _huge_ problem with Asimov. It's amazing that _so_ many people who have
read him are not talking about it. And it is in his characterization of women.
That is, if they exist at all. There is one other Asimov I've read and that's I,
Robot. I admit, I enjoyed the short story collection a lot.

> After I finished it, I clapped my back for finally reading Asimov and started calling myself a big fan.

You read one and then you read another, and you start seeing a pattern. 200
years later in the future, patriarchy still exists. 1000 years later, women are
a crying sobbing mess who work in the kitchens, make giant mistakes, only exist
as wives of other better men and apply make-up for one whole page. Last sentence
is the only female character in Caves of Steel. There are of course other
problems like the technology being outdated, unbelievable and a predictable
ending.

It's extremely off-putting to read something like this. (All the robots are of
course an imitation of men- strong, reliable, physically resembling men.) There
was one female character in I, Robot- Susan Calvin. She is the world's best
robot-psychologist. Extremely intelligent. But there was one quality about her
that Asimov kept beating us in the head with every time she came up in a scene-
her lack of physical beauty. I am calling it out because no other character (read:
male) had any physical shortcomings because they were not mentioned. Maybe there
was one guy who was bald and one has red hair. But that was it. No judgment. Ah
I forget, there was a fleeting mention of another woman who was very pretty and
this exact phrase was used to describe her 'could not put two and two together'.
Said by Susan Calvin.

> This is _not_ how real life works. Women do not like to
put other women down. Instead, they carry them up.

We need to be reading and writing more novels where we have equal
representation. History did not have it but we can imagine worlds where life is
fair and thereby create them.

This is why I cannot read any more Asimov.
